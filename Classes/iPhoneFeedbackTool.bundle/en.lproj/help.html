<h2 id="1">1. Annotations</h2>
<p>When you shake the device, a screenshot of the current view is taken and presented in the annotations view. There you can mark certain points of interest in the screenshot and add notes. If there is personal information in the screenshot that is not supposed to be sent to the developers, you have the ability to black them out.</p>

<h3 id="1.1">1.1 Annotate</h3>
<p>Using a long press or double tap generates a new annotation and presents a dislog for the notes text entry. The input dialog closes after writing the note and tipping on <i>Done</i>. When you tap on the annotations you are able to see the notes and amplify them. To move an annotation you can simply drag & drop them.<br />
<br />
<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> The numbering of the annotations is consecutive and is updated, when annotations in between get deleted.<br />
<br />
<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> There is a limit of max 9 annotations per screenshot.</p>

<h3 id="1.2">1.2 Black Out</h3>
<p>With a tap on <i>Edit</i> the control elements for blacking out are displayed. There are 3 brush sizes and an eraser available. With a tap on <i>Done</i> the control elements are hidden and you get back to the annotations view.</p>

<h2 id="2">2. Message</h2>
<p>This view is for general messages and notes that are too big for an annotation. Here you can also leave your change requests, compliments or any other kind of feedback.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="3">3. Options</h2>
<p>In the options view you can define which information should be sent. Selectable items are contact details, screenshot, message and the stacktrace/log.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3 id="3.1">3.1 Contact Details</h3>
<p>These are the contact details that have been entered when the tool was used for the first time oder that were used the last time a feedback was sent. With a tap on <i>Change</i> a new set of contact details can be entered and saved for this and future feedback submissions.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<h3 id="3.2">3.2 Screenshot</h3>
<p>Just in case there is only a general message and no further information displayed on the taken screenshot, you can deselect it from the feedback data that will be submitted.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<h3 id="3.3">3.3 Message</h3>
<p>If there is no general message or when you do not want to send the entered one anymore, just deselct it..</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<h3 id="3.4">3.4 Stacktrace and Log</h3>
<p>The iPhone Feedback Tool is able to retrieve and attach the stacktrace and application log to the feedback data.. This is very helpful to the developers when they ahve to deal with reported errors. With a tap on <i>View</i> this data can be checked, before it will be submitted to the developers.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="4">4. Submission</h2>
<p>This view collects all the data, prepares them for submission and finally submits them. Depending on the submission mode that the developers have chosen, it might be necessary (like in native mail app), that all data is presented to the user and that he actively has to send them. The tool will close automatically after an information message containing the submission status has been displayed.</p>
