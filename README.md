# Shake 1.0

This project is a drop-in library that supports developers to gather productive feedback from their app users (e.g. beta testers).

## Description

When an app user shakes the device, a screenshot of the current view is taken and the user can annotate it or add a general message as feedback and send it to the developers.

## Project Homepage

## Installation

1. Download the project
1. Unzip it
1. Drag & drop the content of the "classes" folder to your project

The project is already setup to send an e-mail to the developers using the native Apple Mail app.
Enter the name of the development team and the email address in 
  
	iPFTModuleNativeMail.plist

If you dont have ARC enabled, you will need to set a -fobjc-arc compiler flag on the .m source files. 

## Redmine Integration

This tool can be used with Redmine and feedback messages go directly into your issue tracker.
If you want to use the tool with Redmine, you need to change the active module in 

	iPFTConfig.h

Then enter your data in

	iPFTModuleRedmineTicket.plist

Currently, only one module can be used at a time. Future versions of the tool might let you use the modules (Mail, Redmine, ...) simultaneously. 
If you activate more than one module in the config file, the sending process will abort after the first module has been processed.

## Usage

Tell your users to shake their devices :)

On their first shake they see a quick explanation of what the tool is about. They have the ability to enter their name and email address and then the actual feedback process will start.
The feedback process works as follows:

1. As a first step a screenshot of the current view is taken and presented to the user. The user can add up to 9 annotations to the screenshot to explain his issue(s) and edit the screenshot to blackout parts of the image (e.g. privacy protection).
1. In the second step the user can leave a feedback message that is not connected to an annotation.
1. The third step is an overview of the information that will be sent to the developers. Here the user has the ability to exclude information from the submission process.
1. The fourth step sends the data to the developers and informs the user about the submission status, before it sends the user back into the main app.

1. Support Github 
1. Support GitLab 
1. API for custom use
1. Save feedback for later use (support offline feedback)
